      <description>Positive points  All members finished distributed works on time and members were enthusiastic to help those who in trouble. Members shared the ideas when they did their works so that each member could see the whole picture about this project.  Negative points  Since the coding style are different, bugs and code smells occurred when codes from different team members try to merge. We seldom held meeting face-to-face, resulting in most communications are done at Whatsapp which is not very efficient.</description>
