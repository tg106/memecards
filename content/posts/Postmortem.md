## Positive points
- All members finished distributed works on time and members were enthusiastic to help those who in trouble.
- Members shared the ideas when they did their works so that each member could see the whole picture about this project.

## Negative points
- Since the coding style are different, bugs and code smells occurred when codes from different team members try to merge. 
- We seldom held meeting face-to-face, resulting in most communications are done at Whatsapp which is not very efficient.

## Improvement after iteration 2
- We managed to fix all the bugs and code smells that exsited in iteration 2.
- We organized our tests into three layers: Unit test, Integration test and Acceptance test.

## Q&A
### 1. How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?
- We have trimmed some features we designed in iteration 0 such as music/sound effect system, achievement system and a simple tutorial system that show infomation of each interation for first-time player. For the other features, we modified them to suit our project better. For example, to make the game more challenging, we originally want to design three levels of AI player as three game modes. However, now we choose to change gameplay instead of AI player as our game modes to provide different challenges. Thus, normal, random deck and time constrain are the modes we developed in the end.

### 2. What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?
- We learned the importance of team work in this large project development since it is large and no one could finish it alone. Therefore, team members should focus on the parts they are good at and need to complete their jobs on time. That's what we need to keep doing. For what we start to do, we suggest that all members should follow certain coding standard to avoid bugs. In addition, we should meet more frequently and process the project together and stop using only online communication tool.
