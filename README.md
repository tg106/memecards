# Vision Statement

### What is MemeCards?
MemeCards is a fun, interactive yet simple turn-based card game that everyone can enjoy. It is a fusion of the classic Rock-paper-scissor, Pokemon, Yu-gi-oh and Memes. Players will pick their best cards to construct a deck for the battle. Each card has its own power and attributes that can be a huge advantage if used in the right situation. Players will have to use their cards effectively to reduce opponent’s Life Points. The main aim of the game is to make the opponent’s Life Points reach zero. The game ends when a player has no Life Points or card to play. 

When playing this game, players can earn in-game currency through battle. With each win, the player will be rewarded with money to spend in the In-game Shop. Players can buy new cards, items from the shop to add to their collection. With newly collected cards, players can also use them to construct their brand new decks. Cards can also be sorted into categories so that players can easily see which one is the best to pick when constructing their deck. There is also a scoreboard to keep track of the player’s activity. These statistics are saved so that the that is able to see how they have been progressing over time.

### Success Criteria
The game’s success will be measured by two major criteria: Player’s satisfaction and Time spent in-game. First, measuring players satisfaction can be based on the game’s rating. A high rating should indicate that players are happy with the game. Second, the average play-time will be calculated. A high average play-time implies that the game is interesting. The game’s success could also be measured by the amount of money the game makes from in-game purchases because the more money users spent into the game, the more successful it is.
